# Birdhouse
Birdhouse is a simple Twitter clone, made for a CS assignment. It assumes an Apache environment, with MySQL as its database.

For a ready instance, see the `demo` directory. You can also find demo data over at [https://files.ascpixi.dev/birdhouse/birdhouse-demo-data-v1.0.0.zip](https://files.ascpixi.dev/birdhouse/birdhouse-demo-data-v1.0.0.zip). The password for all user accounts for the demo dataset is `password`.

You can found detailed documentation for the project over at [https://ascpixi.dev/birdhouse/](https://ascpixi.dev/birdhouse/).
